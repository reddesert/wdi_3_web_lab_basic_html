  <img src="./jeff.jpg">
    <blockquote>Jeff came to us looking for a special kind of dog - "a real academic", to quote him directly. After some looking and some DSAT testing (Dog SATs), we managed to pair Jeff with Baxter. As you can see from the photo, they're a distinguished match made in heaven.</blockquote>
